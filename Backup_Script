# Source and destiantion path
# $ sets a variable 

$SourceFolder = "C:\...\...\..\Current_Work"      #change path to your own folders
$DestinationFolder = "C:\..\...\...\Backup"

#Copy the file from source to destination 
Copy-Item -Path $SourceFolder\* -Destination $DestinationFolder -Recurse -Force

#Display complete message 
Write-Host "Backup Complete" 


<#-Recurse:
The -Recurse parameter indicates that the Copy-Item cmdlet should copy not 
only the files in the source folder but also all files and subdirectories within the source folder.
In other words, it tells PowerShell to perform a recursive copy, copying the entire directory structure and its contents.

-Force:
The -Force parameter is used to forcefully copy files without asking for confirmation, 
and it also allows overwriting files in the destination folder if they already exist with the same name. 
Without the -Force parameter, PowerShell would prompt you for confirmation before overwriting files. #>
